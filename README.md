## Description
Even today, in 2022 farmers in India remain underpaid, underprivileged, and uneducated. Our project will help to solve this issue by providing farmers with a portal(kiosk in this case) that will gather information from existing sources at a single point of interest in a User-Friendly, Multi-Lingual to increase the reachability of the information and make it accessible at fingertips to masses. 
Our idea is to integrate our device with the already existing E-Mitra kiosk available at the gram panchayat.This device carries out all the required tests on soil and water samples brought by the farmer.Using machine learning and our existing database suggests to the farmer about his/her lands soil properties as well as suggests to them the most profitable crop for them using geographical and land data also the most yielding fertilizers.
